# Expenses-CloudKit


Task : 

Build the following iOS app using CloudKit SDK.
 
 The app will let users manage their personal expenses. Users can
 
 record expenses and see stats on their daily, weekly and monthly
 
 spendings. Each expense will have a title, amount and an
 
 optional notes field. And they can associate categories with each
 
 expense. Example categories are Fuel, Food, Shopping,
 
 Electronics, Subscriptions, etc., Each expense can be associated
 
 with one or more categories. Daily, weekly, monthly stats will
 
 show category wise expense split for that interval. Users must be
 
 able to register with their name, email address and password.
 
 Please use iOS Native SDK only to build this app. You are free to
 
 choose any framework on top of it to finish building it. Also, we
 
 understand that you are not being interviewed for Designer
 
 position so the appâ€™s UI will not be the only criteria in which the
 
 assignment will be evaluated. But please make the app
 
 presentable.
